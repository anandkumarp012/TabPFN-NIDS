Applying TabPFN v2 (Hollmann et al., *Nature* 2025) to network intrusion
detection, and extending it past its 10,000-sample context limit with a
stratified chunked ensemble.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/Sujeethh03/TabPFN-NIDS>

## New features added in this project

This version of the project goes beyond a simple TabPFN baseline and adds a
complete end-to-end intrusion detection pipeline built for real network traffic.
The main additions are:

### 1. PCAP validation and flow extraction

The project can accept raw packet captures, validate them, and convert them into
bidirectional network flows. This is handled by the PCAP and flow-building
modules, which extract per-flow summaries such as packet counts, byte totals,
protocols, timing, and direction. This makes the system usable on real network
captures instead of only prebuilt tabular datasets.

### 2. Domain-aware feature engineering

The feature pipeline now computes ML-ready flow statistics from the extracted
traffic, including:

- basic flow metrics such as duration, packet counts, and byte totals
- directional statistics for forward/backward traffic behavior
- timing-based features such as inter-arrival times and burst characteristics
- packet-length summaries and distribution statistics
- TCP flag indicators and protocol-aware flow attributes

These features capture network behavior that a vanilla tabular model would miss,
which is especially valuable for attack detection where traffic shape is often a
strong signal.

### 3. Stratified chunked TabPFN ensemble

TabPFN has a context limit of roughly 10,000 training rows. Real NIDS datasets
are much larger, so the model is extended with a stratified chunking strategy:

- the dataset is split into smaller balanced chunks
- each chunk is treated as a separate in-context TabPFN training set
- predictions from all chunks are aggregated into a final decision
- chunk weights can be adjusted using confidence-based aggregation

This keeps the method faithful to TabPFN while making it practical for large
network datasets.

### 4. Dynamic parallel inference for large traffic data

The inference layer supports chunked prediction across large datasets and can
combine multiple models when configured. This helps scale evaluation and reduces
memory pressure when processing large input matrices or many flows.

### 5. Ground-truth labeling and pipeline evaluation

The repository also includes logic for aligning extracted flows with official
UNSW-NB15 metadata, labeling them as benign or malicious, and validating the
resulting dataset before model training. This allows the project to move from raw
capture data to labeled, model-ready examples in a reproducible pipeline.

### 6. End-to-end training and reporting workflow

The codebase now includes a structured pipeline that moves from data validation to:

- feature extraction
- labeling
- cleaning and preprocessing
- train/test split and leakage checks
- TabPFN inference
- metric computation and result reporting

This makes the project much more than a notebook experiment; it is a reusable
network intrusion detection workflow.

## Quick start

With Python 3.11 and an activated virtualenv (full setup in [§1](#1-setup)):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .
kaggle datasets download -d hassan06/nslkdd -p data/raw/nsl-kdd --unzip
python scripts/run_baseline.py --seed 42 --test-size 5000 --n-estimators 2
```

Writes a timestamped CSV to `reports/`. Expect **F1 ≈ 0.75, ROC-AUC ≈ 0.95**.
Budget the runtime first — see [§3](#3-run-the-experiments); the same command
without `--test-size` and `--n-estimators` runs for hours.

### Windows live monitoring

Install Wireshark with Npcap, verify `tshark --version` and `tshark -D`, then
install the live extras and start the single-screen monitor:

```powershell
pip install -e ".[live]"
python main.py --live
```

Use `python main.py --live --interface 1` to select a specific TShark interface.
The capture, flow builder, feature pipeline, fitted preprocessing artifacts, and
TabPFN inference are shared with the API implementation. See
[docs/LIVE_MONITORING.md](docs/LIVE_MONITORING.md) for setup and troubleshooting.

For the full reproduction guide — hardware requirements, dataset acquisition,
per-experiment expected outputs, tolerance bands and troubleshooting — see
**[docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md)**.

> **On terminology:** TabPFN takes labelled rows as in-context examples at
> inference time, so this is *in-context learning*, not zero-shot. The term
> "zero-shot" is used only for the cross-dataset transfer experiment, where no
> target-domain labels are involved.

---

## 1. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sujeethh03/TabPFN-NIDS.git
cd TabPFN-NIDS

python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .          # required: notebooks and tests import the package by name
```

`pip install -e .` is **not optional**. This is a src-layout project: the
importable package is `tabpfn_nids`, living in `src/`. Without the editable
install nothing can import it.

```python
from tabpfn_nids.data_pipeline import load_nsl_kdd     # correct
from src.data_pipeline.loader import load_nsl_kdd      # wrong - there is no `src` package
```

If you hit `ModuleNotFoundError`, the fix is `pip install -e .`, not
`PYTHONPATH=.`. Setting `PYTHONPATH` to the repo root makes `import src.*`
appear to work and then breaks the moment you run from another directory.

Verify the environment:

```bash
python smoke_test.py
```

Runs TabPFN on a small sklearn dataset and prints versions, device and the
pinned checkpoint. **~14s**, or a few minutes the first time while the
checkpoint downloads. Exits 1 on failure.

```
  python         3.11.9 (arm64)
  torch          2.13.0
  tabpfn         8.5.0
  checkpoint     tabpfn-v2-classifier.ckpt
  device         mps
  ...
  Accuracy       0.9649
Smoke test PASSED. Environment is ready.
```

---

## 2. Get the data

Datasets are gitignored, so a fresh clone has none. NSL-KDD is the only one
needed to reproduce every result in this repo.

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d hassan06/nslkdd -p data/raw/nsl-kdd --unzip
```

This needs a Kaggle API token in `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`. You can equally
download the archive by hand — all that matters is that `KDDTrain+.txt` and
`KDDTest+.txt` end up in `data/raw/nsl-kdd/`.

Check it landed:

```bash
python -c "from tabpfn_nids.data_pipeline import load_nsl_kdd; \
           tr, te = load_nsl_kdd(); print(tr.shape, te.shape)"
# (125973, 43) (22544, 43)
```

See [docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md) §3 for the other two
datasets and the data-quality defects in CIC-IDS-2018.

---

## 3. Run the experiments

Every script appends a timestamped CSV to `reports/`, carrying its own
provenance: seed, hardware, device, library versions, checkpoint and git commit.

```bash
# Baseline - vanilla TabPFN, one 10,000-row context
python scripts/run_baseline.py --seed 42 --test-size 5000 --n-estimators 2

# Enhancement 1 - stratified chunked ensemble
python scripts/run_enhanced.py --seed 42 --test-size 5000 --n-estimators 2

# Enhancement 2 - engineered-feature ablation, with/without
python scripts/run_feature_ablation.py --seed 42 --max-chunks 3 --test-size 1000 \
       --n-estimators 2 --max-service-flag-categories 40

# Roll results up into the comparison table
python scripts/summarize_runs.py --tag baseline
python scripts/generate_comparison_table.py   # -> reports/comparison_table.{md,csv}
python scripts/build_comparison_table.py      # -> reports/tables/comparison_table.{md,csv}
```

The two table scripts are **not** interchangeable and write to different
places. `generate_comparison_table.py` builds the headline three-arm table
(vanilla / chunked ensemble / +engineered) at `reports/comparison_table.md`.
`build_comparison_table.py` emits a per-experiment breakdown with mean ± std
across seeds at `reports/tables/comparison_table.md`.

`--n-estimators`, `--test-size` and the seed **must match across arms** or the
comparison measures the wrong thing.

### Budget the runtime before you start

Prediction cost is linear in `--test-size` and **superlinear** in context size.
Measured on an M1, `n_estimators=2`, seconds per 1,000 test rows:

| context rows | 1,000 | 2,500 | 5,000 | 10,000 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| s / 1,000 test rows | 15 | 49 | 144 | **459** |

So `run_baseline.py --test-size 5000` at the full 10,000-row context is a
**~40 minute** job, not a 3-minute one. For a quick check use:

```bash
python scripts/run_baseline.py --context-size 5000 --test-size 500 --n-estimators 2
```

which finishes in about 75s. The chunked ensemble multiplies this by the chunk
count — full 51-chunk coverage of NSL-KDD costs roughly 2.5s *per test row*.

---

## 4. See the results

### The notebooks

Four notebooks, meant to be read top to bottom. Runtimes are measured on an M1.

| notebook | what it shows | runtime |
|---|---|---|
| [`01_reproduction.ipynb`](notebooks/01_reproduction.ipynb) | the baseline end to end: load, dataset stats, preprocessing, fit, metrics, confusion matrix | **46s** |
| [`02_enhancement.ipynb`](notebooks/02_enhancement.ipynb) | single context vs chunked ensemble vs +engineered features, on one fixed test set | **4.4 min** |
| [`03_ablations.ipynb`](notebooks/03_ablations.ipynb) | context-size and stratification ablations, from cached CSVs | **3s** |
| [`04_results_summary.ipynb`](notebooks/04_results_summary.ipynb) | every result CSV, the comparison table, all figures, written findings | **4s** |

```bash
jupyter lab notebooks/01_reproduction.ipynb
```

03 and 04 re-run no inference — they only read `reports/` — so they execute in
seconds and are safe to run anywhere. 01 and 02 call TabPFN live.

Notebooks 01 and 02 run at **reduced scale** so they finish in minutes; each one
says so at the top and prints its own numbers next to the full-scale runs of
record. The pipeline is identical, only the row counts differ.

Execute them all headlessly:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=3600 \
    --inplace notebooks/0[1-4]*.ipynb
```

### The raw results

```
reports/
├── baseline_<timestamp>_seed<N>.csv    one row per run, with full provenance
├── feature_ablation_*.csv              Enhancement 2, with/without arms
├── ablation_*.csv                      context-size and stratification sweeps
├── comparison_table.{csv,md}           all arms side by side
└── figures/                            confusion matrices, ROC, PR curves
```

`reports/comparison_table.md` (from `generate_comparison_table.py`) is the
headline summary artifact. Arms that have not
been run are printed as *not run* rather than omitted.

**Read the noise floor before reading any delta.** The baseline's F1 standard
deviation across three seeds is **0.0229**. A difference smaller than that is
seed-to-seed variation, not an effect — the notebooks apply this rule explicitly
rather than leaving it to the reader.

---

## 5. Run the tests

```bash
pytest                # fast suite, ~10s
pytest -v             # per-test names
pytest -m slow        # adds real TabPFN inference (minutes)
pytest tests/test_chunker.py -v      # one module
```

Expected: **163 passed, 4 deselected**. The 4 deselected carry the `slow`
marker — they run real TabPFN inference and are excluded from the default suite
by `addopts = "-q -m 'not slow'"` in `pyproject.toml`. That is configuration,
not failure.

The suite covers the loader, preprocessor, chunker, ensemble, feature
engineering, metrics, evaluation and repo structure. It also asserts the
checkpoint pin never reverts to `"auto"` — see the warning below for why that
matters.

---

## Results snapshot

Vanilla TabPFN on NSL-KDD: 10,000-row stratified context, 5,000-row stratified
test sample, `n_estimators=2`, MPS backend, 3 seeds.

| metric | mean ± std |
|---|---|
| accuracy | 0.7653 ± 0.0212 |
| precision | 0.9347 ± 0.0269 |
| recall | 0.6318 ± 0.0213 |
| **f1_score** | **0.7539 ± 0.0229** |
| **roc_auc** | **0.9555 ± 0.0040** |

Two things this table is really saying:

**The error is almost all recall.** Precision 0.93 against recall 0.63 — the
model is right when it flags an attack but misses about a third of them. That is
the expected consequence of NSL-KDD's 17 attack types that appear only in the
test split, not a bug.

**ROC-AUC 0.9555 versus F1 0.7539.** The model *ranks* attacks well; the default
0.5 threshold just places the operating point poorly. Threshold tuning is the
cheapest available improvement.

The F1 std of **0.0229** is the noise floor: a single-seed delta below ~2.3
percentage points is not evidence of an effect.

## Two things that will bite you

**The default checkpoint is gated and is the wrong model.** `tabpfn` 8.5.0
defaults to `model_path="auto"`, which resolves to the gated HuggingFace repo
`Prior-Labs/tabpfn_3` — a *different, newer* model than the Nature 2025
publication. This project pins `tabpfn-v2-classifier.ckpt` from the ungated
`Prior-Labs/TabPFN-v2-clf`, and a test asserts it never reverts to `"auto"`.

**MPS memory is the binding constraint.** Metal does not release memory when a
Python reference is dropped, so a sequential chunked run accumulates
allocations until it dies — ours did, at chunk 4 of 13. `TabPFNWrapper.free()`
fixes it. Separately, engineered features at full cardinality (463 columns)
exhaust MPS regardless of batch size; use `--max-service-flag-categories`.

Both are documented in detail in [docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md](docs/REPRODUCIBILITY.md).
